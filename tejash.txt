I cherish the quite pauses where her eyes say all I long to hear
I wonder where you found the charm to turn hours into minutes.
You play, I lose—funny how I never want to win. 	
From butterflies to getting scoldings — what a cute fall 	
Some silences aren’t peaceful — they’re just full of you.
Her eyes were the kind that stayed with you, even in the silence.
Your every move is like a dance in the rain, where the storm fades and all that's left is the beauty of your grace
Her eyes are a blend of warmth and cold, like the first light of dawn breaking through a cloudy sky.
